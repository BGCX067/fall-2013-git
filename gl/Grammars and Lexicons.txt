Analyzing a language you don't know

=============================================

Rules that you know and rules that you aren't aware of

Linguistics is about describing what people do when they use language, not 
prescriptive rules. 

It is NOT about writing "good" language

It's about "normal" language use
Things that are formal, informal, dialects, styles, etc

Knowledge of Language

"Every normal speaker of any natual language has acquired an 
immensely rich and systematic body of unconcous knowledge, which
can be investigated by consulting speakers' intuitive judgements."

"Langauges are object of onsiderable complexity, which an be studied
scientifically. That is, we can formulate hypotheses about linguistic 
structure and test them against the facts of particular languages."

Reflextive pronouns: what?

THEORIES

1. Hypothesis one: Semantic Hypothesis

 -- When the thing acted on is the same as the person (actor). 

2. Hypothesis two: Syntactic Hypothesis

 -- When the object is the same as the subject
 -- A subject can't be a reflexive pronoun
 
3. Hypothesis three: Linear Hypothesis

 -- Refer to something that was mentioned earlier
 
4. Hypothesis four: Brute Force

 -- Overwhelming evidence, you just follow rules because thats
    "what you hear," so to speak

From Wikipedia:

A reflexive pronoun is a pronoun that is preceded by the noun, adjective, 
adverb or pronoun to which it refers (its antecedent) within the same clause. 
In generative grammar, a reflexive pronoun is an anaphor that must be bound by 
its antecedent (see binding). In some languages, there is a difference between 
reflexive and non-reflexive pronouns; but the exact conditions that determine 
whether or not something be bound are not yet well defined and depend on the language 
in question. It depends on the part of the sentence containing the pronoun.
